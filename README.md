# DNS-Resolver

Project Description:

This project is focused on creating a DNS query program using C++ and C. 
The purpose is to deepen understanding of non-ASCII application-layer protocols and achieve reliable transport over UDP. The program issues recursive queries to user-provided DNS servers and parses the responses. 
Special attention is given to directly utilizing UDP and manually parsing DNS responses without the aid of external libraries. The project also uses direct memory operations for with pointers. This hands-on project serves as a practical exploration into specialized application-layer protocols and UDP communication.
